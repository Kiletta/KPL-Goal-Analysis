This analysis shows that whenever home teams would score 2+ goals majority of matches resulted in wins. This is a contrast however to whenever home teams failed to reach the two-goal threshold since the outcomes were most likely to end in draws or losses. This indicates that by scoring at least two goals a home teams probability winning a match increases. ,,,
