# KPL-Goal-Analysis
The objective of this project is to assess and determine whether a goal-scoring threshold exists that can significantly increase a teams probability of winning a match in the Kenyan Premier League.

**Dataset**
The dataset consists of 30 Kenyan Premier League matches and includes:
   -Home team
   -Away team
   -Home goals
   -Away goals
Match outcomes were programmatically derived using conditional logic.

**Methodology**
-Derived home and away match results using conditional formulas
-Engineered goal threshold features (2+ Goals)
-Used pivot tables to aggregate match outcomes
-Visualized Results using stacked column charts

**Key Findings**
-By home teams scoring two or more goals they won a majority of the matches.
-By away teams scoring two or more goals they also showed a high win probability.
-Teams scoring fewer than two goals were more likely to result in a draw or a loss.

**Recommendation**
-By teams prioritizing to score more than two goals during matches this significantly increases the likelihood of winning regardless of the venue, either home or away.
